<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p>The Association and the Union agree that the purpose of this Agreement is to set forth terms and conditions of employment relating to rates of pay, hours of work and other working conditions affecting the employees covered by this Collective Agreement as well as providing a means of settling disputes and grievances regarding alleged violations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<h2>2. Application</h2>

<h3>2.1</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall apply with respect to all of the Association's employees comprised within the bargaining unit prescribed by the Alberta Labour Relations Board Certificate No 99-2014, or the said Certificate as may be amended from time to time excepting managerial employees and those employed in a confidential capacity in respect to labour relations.</p>

<h3>2.2</h3>
<p>The Association recognizes the Union as the exclusive agency for all employees as defined in the Labour Relations Board Certificate as referred to in Clause 2.1.</p>

<h3>2.3</h3>
<p>The Alberta Teachers' Association (the Association) shall mean that body established by the <em>Teaching Profession Act</em> (RSA 2000 c T-2).</p>

<h3>2.4 Discrimination</h3>

<h4>2.4.1</h4>
<p>The Association agrees that it will not take punitive action against any employees as a result of their membership in and legal activities of the Union.</p>

<h2>3. Definitions</h2>

<h3>3.1 Employee Categories</h3>

<h4>3.1.1</h4>
<p>An employee is a person included in the bargaining unit and paying Union dues.</p>
<p>Employees shall be categorized as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Persons in permanent positions:</strong> authorized by the Association and employed on a full- or part-time basis and who have successfully completed the probationary period.</p>

<p><strong>Persons in temporary positions:</strong> employed on a full- or part-time basis to fill a permanent position for a definite length of time not in excess of eighteen months or to work on a project where there is no anticipated need for the employee's services beyond eighteen months. It is agreed that the employment of a person in a temporary position to fill a permanent position shall be restricted to reasons of illness, approved leaves of absence or for other reasons mutually agreed between the parties.</p>

<p>The Association will notify the Union of the reason for the temporary position.</p>

<h4>3.1.2</h4>
<p>The Association shall notify the Union when casual staff are hired. Casual staff are defined as persons engaged by the Association to perform work required by it for time periods not to exceed 420 hours in a year (September 01 to August 31) who are exempted from the provisions of this Agreement. Such persons shall be paid at an hourly wage rate calculated (per Clause 12.4) from the starting rate of the wage category to which the staff member was hired, plus required vacation pay. Notwithstanding the above, if the need for a casual employee is in caretaking or cafeteria, the limit is 560 hours. With mutual agreement between the Union and the Association, causal hours can be extended to meet long term Association coverage needs.</p>

<h4>3.1.3 Probationary Period</h4>
<p>Probationary period is the first six (6) months of employment during which time an employee may be terminated by the Association. An employee's probation period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union.</p>

<li>COVID Leave</li>
<li>Domestic Violence Leave</li>
<li>Citizenship Ceremony Leave</li>

</ul>

<p>Service does not accrue for any period of leave in excess of ten (10) calendar days in any year (September 01 â€“ August 31) during which salary is not paid, while in receipt of Extended Disability Benefits under the Alberta School Employee Benefit Plan greater than 16 weeks, periods of disciplinary suspension from duties without pay; and periods of layoff in excess of ninety (90) calendar days.</p>

<p>Where a temporary employee changes to a permanent employee without a break in service, seniority will date from the original date of hiring as a temporary employee.</p>

<h3>3.3</h3>
<p>Wages and benefits established by this Agreement shall apply to all employees unless otherwise specified.</p>

<h3>3.4 Video Surveillance</h3>
<p>The Association uses cameras for the protection and safety of staff, general public and property. This does not include monitoring employee performance.</p>

<p>An Employee's initial placement within the steps in a pay grid in Appendix B is determined upon appointment. Factors such as previous experience, scarcity or uniqueness of required skills, and exceptional ability may be recognized by placement above step one. When this occurs, the Union will be notified. An Employee shall advance at the rate of one step after successful completion of the probationary period specified in 3.1.3 and on each full year of service to a maximum salary of the category is reached.</p>

<h4>11.2.3</h4>
<p>Employees who request transfers to permanent positions having:</p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> the same pay category will retain their salary pay grade and step progression with time.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> a lower pay category will retain the salary paid at the pay grade from which they moved until such time as the salary in the lower pay grade exceeds the salary to which they were entitled prior to the transfer.</p>

<p>Employees who move from:</p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> part-time to full-time employment do not retain the salary grade from the part-time position but do retain step position.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> full-time to part-time employment do not retain the salary grade from the full-time position but do retain step position.</p>

<p>Members on layoff provisions who transfer to another position do not maintain the previous pay grade but are entitled to step progression with time.</p>

<h2>Letter of Understanding #1</h2>

<h3>RE: Transition to the new job classification system</h3>

<p>The Association and the union agreed as per the letter of understanding signed 2019 03 01, that if through the transition to the new classification system positions were reclassified to a lower pay grade, those individuals currently employed in those positions would be red circled.</p>

<p>The Association and the union met on 2020 03 05 to review the outcome of the new job classification system. The parties agreed that the individuals, who at that time, were employed in positions that were reclassified to a lower classification would have their positions grandfathered rather than red circled. Individuals employed in grandfathered positions would continue to be eligible to receive in-range salary adjustments and future negotiated salary increases. The new classification for a grandfathered position would become effective when the individual vacates their position.</p>

<h2>Letter of Understanding #2</h2>

<h3>RE: On Call Implementation</h3>

<p>In the development of the on call policy Letter of Understanding, the Association and the Union will take into account the following factors for staff who agree to work on call:</p>

<ol>
<li>equitable assignment of on call shifts;</li>
<li>sick call in procedure when on call;</li>
<li>ability to trade on call shifts between staff;</li>
<li>circumstances and acceptable response time when a physical call back to the building is required versus when issues can be handled via phone calls;</li>
<li>expectations regarding fitness for work and maintaining acceptable levels of technical competency and education;</li>
<li>treatment of staff if they wish to step down out of the role.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Letter of Understanding #3</h2>

<h3>RE: Pension Plan</h3>

<p>As a result of the Association's decision to transfer the Office Staff Pension Plan to the Local Authorities Pension Plan, the parties agree to amend article 27.3.4 to "For the purposes of this Clause, pension plan shall mean either the Local Authorities Pension Plan or the Alberta Teachers' Retirement Fund." The Association will ensure that all employee entitlements in the Office Staff Pension Plan as of 2024 12 31, are maintained for the transfer to the Local Authorities Pension Plan and that no further contribution by employees will be required to complete the transfer of their accrued benefits as of 2024 12 31.</p>

<h2>Letter of Understanding #4</h2>

<h3>RE: Creation of New "G" Salary Category for Trades Positions</h3>

<p>As a result of the Association's need to recruit and maintain qualified and ticketed Tradespeople to perform essential in building work and maintain effective ATA operations, it is understood that previous pay grids and compensation models in this Agreement are currently insufficient to replace essential trades staff such as plumbers and electricians.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Association has developed and approved a new two step Trades salary grid for implementation as follows:</p>
